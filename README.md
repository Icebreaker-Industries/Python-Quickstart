# Code like a Yeshiva Guy
**This quickstart guide is a work in progress. We're figuring things out.**  
This guide is intended to help you start learning Python, using the the tools that FTI students will eventually use for collaborative projects - G-d willing and the creek don't rise.  
The overall goal of this guide is that you learn to use the Python language. There are two basic approaches we're trying.
##1. Tutorials in a Browser
Jetbrains Academy seems to have good tutorials in browser. This means you don't have to install anything.  
Visit <https://hyperskill.org/onboarding?track=python> and register for an account. Select the Python Developer Path and start working. The reading is straightforward, and there are small tests that involve writing code in broswer.
##2. Install the tools that we use in the real world
Jetbrains makes the only great Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. Once we do projects together, I think you're going to need it, and Jetbrains offers great tutorials right there in the same tool that the pros use.  
**Supports Windows 10, Max, Linux. FreeBDS, I probably can't help you make this work.**  
### Steps:
### A. Install Python (skip if you aren't using Windows)
Go to <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. Click the big yellow button that says "Download Python". When the installer downloads, run it. Accept all the defaults.  
#### What was that? Conceptual stuff, skip if you like.  
Computers and people can't communicate directly. Microchips understand series of beeps, arriving 3.5 billion times per second. People understand words. We need a go between. That's what a programming language does. "Python", like other High Level Languages, consists of published rules for translating from some words-based system of commands into beeps (sort of - the details are unimportant). When you install Python, you're installing an Interpreter, a computer program that translates one line at a time into something the computer can understand.  
### B. Install PyCharm Community Edition
Go to <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download>. You should see a blue button, which downloads the professional edition (which I love), and a black button, which downloads the community edition (which I also love). Community is free, so click the black button.  
Once the installer downloads, run it, and click through it, accepting all the defaults.  
#### What was that? Conceptual stuff, skip if you like.  
You could write your English Papers in notepad, if you like. It would be a pain though. Microsoft Work knows what to expect, so it can alert you to errors and suggest changes. It can remember previous versions, and roll back to them. It can look up important information online. It can collaborate. It can remember citations and let you look them up while you work. Word does all these things, because the developers spend 20 years taking notes on what tools you'd want to help you with the task of writing English. The same applies to writing code. We could write our code in notepad, but it would quickly become too much of a pain. So when we write big software, we work inside an Integrated Development Environment, which manages the files that contain your code, and also offers other helpful tools.  
### C. Install Git (skip if you aren't on Windows)
*This one might be tricky. If you're wasting time, getting mad, text me and we'll fix it later. You can start without this.*  
Git is an awesome, lightweight, powerful, elegant tool, that [no one understands how to use](https://xkcd.com/1597/).  
We use it for version control and collaboration. You can try something, and if it doesn't work out, roll back, or switch to the alternate history where you didn't try it. You can push your changes to a host online. We'll use github.com. If the whole team pushes changes to a repository, then they can share all of their work quickly, and collaborate on big projects. Git can also make a huge mess that no one understands how to clean up. But we'll get to that.  

## Good Luck! Keep in touch and send feedback.
