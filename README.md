# Code like a Yeshiva Guy
**This quickstart guide is a work in progress. We're figuring things out.**  
This guide is intended to help you start learning Python, using the the tools that FTI students will eventually use for collaborative projects - G-d willing and the creek don't rise.  
The overall goal of this guide is that you learn to use the Python language.
# There are two basic approaches we're trying:  
## 1. Tutorials in a Browser
Jetbrains Academy seems to have good tutorials in browser. This means you don't have to install anything.  
Visit <https://hyperskill.org/onboarding?track=python> and register for an account. Select the Python Developer Path and start working. The reading is straightforward, and there are small tests that involve writing code in broswer.  
If you go this route, you're good for now. We'll teach you the tools we need later. You can close this guide. Enjoy coding.  
## 2. Install the tools that we use in the real world  
Jetbrains makes the only great Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. Once we do projects together, I think you're going to need it, and Jetbrains offers great tutorials right there in the same tool that the pros use.  
**Supports Windows 10, Max, Linux. FreeBDS, I probably can't help you make this work.**  
### Steps:
### A. Install Python (skip if you aren't using Windows)
Go to <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. Click the big yellow button that says "Download Python". When the installer downloads, run it. Accept all the defaults.  
#### What was that? Conceptual stuff, skip if you like.  
> Computers and people can't communicate directly. Microchips understand series of beeps, arriving 3.5 billion times per second. People understand words. We need a go between. That's what a programming language does. "Python", like other High Level Languages, consists of published rules for translating from some words-based system of commands into beeps (sort of - the details are unimportant). When you install Python, you're installing an Interpreter, a computer program that translates one line at a time into something the computer can understand.  
### B. Install PyCharm Community Edition
Go to <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download>. You should see a blue button, which downloads the professional edition (which I love), and a black button, which downloads the community edition (which I also love). Community is free, so click the black button.  
Once the installer downloads, run it, and click through it, accepting all the defaults.  
#### What was that? Conceptual stuff, skip if you like.  
> You could write your English Papers in notepad, if you like. It would be a pain though. On the other hand, it's easy to use a word processor. Microsoft Word knows what to expect, so it can alert you to errors and suggest changes. It can remember previous versions, and roll back to them. It can look up important information online. It can collaborate. It can remember citations and let you look them up while you work. Word does all these things, because the developers spent 20 years taking notes on what tools you'd want to help you with the task of writing English. The same applies to writing code. We could write our code in notepad, but it would quickly become too much of a pain. So when we write big software, we work inside an Integrated Development Environment, which manages the files that contain your code, and also offers other helpful tools.  
### B.Jr. Install Education Plugin and start course  
- After PyCharm installs, run it. A small grey popup should appear, and offer options like "Create New Project".
- Click on the gear button to open settings, and then click Plugins.
- In the Marketplace, search for the Edu Tools plugin. It should say that it's published by JetBrains.
- Install it and make sure it's enabled.
- Click OK to close the plugins configuration.
- Above "Create New Project", "Learn and Teach" should now appear. Click on that button and then Browse Courses.
- You have a few choices now.
  - You can Start hyperskill projects, which means that you do the same JetBrains Academy challenges as the people who chose to work in browser, way up in section A. This choice opens a browser to try to get you signed into hyperskill. Once it's happy with your sign in, PyCharm will open the same challenge questions that you'd see on the site.
  - You can Browse Courses. There's a lot of good content available in here. The top course, Introduction to Python is good, although the tests sometimes glitch.  
You're now good to go. Start working through a course.  
### C. Install Git (skip if you aren't on Windows)
*This one might be tricky. If you're wasting time, getting mad, text me and we'll fix it later. You can start without this.*  
Git is an awesome, lightweight, powerful, elegant tool, that [no one understands how to use](https://xkcd.com/1597/).  
We use it for version control and collaboration. You can try something, and if it doesn't work out, roll back, or switch to the alternate history where you didn't try it. You can push your changes to a host online. We'll use github.com. If the whole team pushes changes to a repository, then they can share all of their work quickly, and collaborate on big projects. Git can also make a huge mess that no one understands how to clean up. But we'll get to that.  

## Good Luck! Keep in touch and send feedback.
